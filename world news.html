        <p><span class="span1">Kashmir</span>United Nations,Speakers at the Kashmir Solidarity Day event titled “Keeping the Promise of Self-Determination Alive for the People of Jammu and Kashmir”, hosted jointly by the Permanent Mission of Pakistan to the UN and the Consulate General of Pakistan in New York, reaffirmed their steadfast support for Kashmiris in their struggle for right to self-determination. They emphatically called for the resolution of the longstanding dispute in line with the relevant Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of Kashmiri people.

            The event held at the chancery building in New York brought together members of the OIC Contact Group on Kashmir, students, academics, journalists and the members of the Kashmiri diaspora community and overseas Pakistanis.
            
            Those who spoke on the occasion included Ambassador Munir Akram, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Zafar Iqbal Malik, Minister of Higher Education, AJK Government; Ambassador Ahmet Yildiz, Permanent Representative of Turkiye to the UN, Ambassador Tofig Musayev, Permanent Representative of Azerbaijan to the UN; Ambassador Hameed Ajibaiye Opeloyeru, Permanent Observer of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC); Mr. Mohammed Abdulaziz Alateek, Deputy Permanent Representative of Saudi Arabia; Mr. Shahal Khoso, researcher and academic; Mr. Amir Ahmad Atozai, Consul General of Pakistan in New York and Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Alternate Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN.
            
            In his welcome remarks, Ambassador Munir Akram thanked the members of the OIC Contact Group on Jammu and Kashmir for their unwavering support to Kashmiris’ right to self-determination. He said that Kashmiris’ story of defiance of the Indian occupation is about fundamental rights and justice. He paid rich tributes to generations of Kashmiris for their sacrifices and struggle for their legitimate fundamental rights.
            
            Ambassador Munir Akram said that the UN resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir are valid and in force, adding that no national legislation by India could alter the international character of the Kashmir dispute. He explained that UN resolutions could be changed in two ways; either they are implemented or the Security Council amends them, arguing that there was no other way their legal status could be changed. Referring to the abrogation of Article 370, he said that the Indian actions were null and void.
            
            Ambassador Akram emphasized that under Article 25 of the UN Charter, India was obliged to implement the UNSC resolutions. He informed the audience that following India’s illegal actions of August 5, 2019, the issue of Jammu and Kashmir was raised at the Security Council three times.
            
            He said that the task before Pakistani diplomats was to make the international community aware of the threats to regional peace and security in the absence of just and peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute.
            
            Zafar Iqbal Malik, AJK Minister for Higher Education, thanked the government and the people of Pakistan for raising a consistent voice for the rights of Kashmiris. He reminded the international community of its obligations towards Kashmiris, stating that the people of Azad Jammu and Kashmir like their brothers and sisters in IIOJK were waiting for dispensation of justice.
            
            In his remarks, Ambassador Ahmet Yildiz, Permanent Representative of Turkiye to the UN, conveyed Turkiye’s support for Kashmiris’ right to self-determination in line with the UNSC resolutions. He also thanked the government and the people of Pakistan for standing by Turkiye during difficult times.
            
            The Turkish Ambassador said that we have followed with great concern what Kashmiris have been made to endure, adding that his country opposed unilateral steps taken by India in Jammu and Kashmir including demographic and other administrative and legal changes there. He said that the annulment of Article 370 complicated the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and emphasized that the relevant UNSC resolutions provided the framework for just resolution of the Kashmir dispute.
            
            Voicing his country’s support for Kashmiris’ right to self-determination, Ambassador Tofig Musayev, Permanent Representative of Azerbaijan to the UN, highlighted the need for the resolution of Jammu and Kashmir in accordance with the international norms, UN Charter and Security Council resolutions. He said that continuous efforts needed to be made for the establishment of sustainable peace in South Asia, adding that the OIC was actively engaged in matters of peace and security.
            
            Ambassador Hameed Ajibaiye Opeloyeru, Permanent Observer of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), in his remarks, reiterated the OIC’s strong support for the Kashmir cause. He demanded that all illegal measures initiated on August 5, 2019, which sought to change the demographic structure of Jammu and Kashmir, should be revoked.
            
            Ambassador Hameed referred to the various decisions and resolutions of the Islamic Summit and the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers on Jammu and Kashmir and urged the international community to play a more active role to resolve the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. He said that the right to self-determination sprang from the UN Charter and UNSC resolutions, stating that efforts needed to be made to mobilize public opinion and especially the youth.
            
            Mr. Mohammed Abdulaziz Alateek, Deputy Permanent Representative of Saudi Arabia, highlighted the need for constructive dialogue and engagement for peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. He said that upholding and respecting the aspirations of Kashmiris was important in this regard.
            
            Mr. Shahal Khoso, researcher and academic at Yale University, underlined the need for serious efforts to create an intellectual academic infrastructure for Kashmir studies as a discipline that is empirical, comparative and globally oriented. He called for making Kashmir the part of mainstream academic discourse through different initiatives.
            
            In his speech, Consul General of Pakistan in New York, Mr. Aamer Ahmed Atozai, condemned the grave human rights violations in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), especially following India’s unilateral revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status on August 5, 2019.
            
            He lauded the New York State Assembly’s 2021 resolution declaring February 5 as “Kashmir-American Day”, calling it a significant recognition of the Kashmiri people’s struggle and growing global awareness of India’s rights violations.
            
            Reaffirming Pakistan’s diplomatic, political, and moral support for Kashmiris, he urged the international community to break its silence on the suffering in IIOJK
            
            In his concluding remarks, Ambassador Asim Iftithar Ahmad, Alternate Permanent Representative of Pakistan, said that the struggle of the Kashmiri people for their inalienable right to self-determination is vital, regardless of any geostrategic considerations. He said that this right is enshrined in the UN Charter, international law, UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
            
            He said that the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) dispute is not just a territorial issue it has legal, political, human rights, and peace and security dimensions that demand urgent international attention.
            
            Ambassador Asim explained that the mechanism for the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute is clearly defined in relevant UNSC resolutions. The focus remains on the plebiscite that allows Kashmiris to determine their own future, as their will is supreme, he explained.
            
            He recalled the UN Secretary-General’s statement of August 8, 2019, in which the latter reaffirmed that the position of the United Nations on Jammu and Kashmir is governed by relevant UNSC resolutions, adding that this stance underscored the legitimacy of Pakistan’s stance on the issue.
            
            Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad said that Pakistan remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting the Kashmiri people, in line with international law and the UN framework. He lauded the role of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), comprising 57 countries, and said that the OIC has consistently upheld the just cause of Kashmiris, reflecting the broad-based international recognition of their plight.
            
            To further strengthen support for Kashmiris, he stressed the need for a comprehensive strategy, focusing on Engaging with U.S. lawmakers and decision-makers to build greater political and legal backing.
            
            Expanding legal efforts to highlight India’s violations of international law and human rights.
            
            Raising the Kashmir issue across the entire UN system, ensuring continuous global attention.
            
            Leveraging media, particularly social media platforms, to counter misinformation and amplify Kashmiri voices.
            
            Reinvigorating academic and think-tank discussions on Jammu and Kashmir to shape informed global discourse.
            
            Ambassador Asim said that it is imperative that the international community breaks its silence and upholds its moral and legal responsibility toward the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). He said that Pakistan will continue its diplomatic, political, and moral support for the Kashmiri cause until a just and lasting solution is achieved in accordance with UN resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.

    <h2 class="heading">Israel fears for condition of remaining hostages, <br>
        as intel suggests male captives treated worse <br>
        than women</h2>
    <div class="container1">
        <p><span class="span1">Hamas</span>When three Israeli hostages emerged at the weekend, emaciated and gaunt after 16 months in Hamas captivity, Israelis were shocked by the images.

            But inside the Israeli government, top officials were not surprised.
            
            The Israeli government has had intelligence for months indicating that many of the remaining living hostages are in poor health, two Israeli officials tell CNN. “It wasn’t a surprise for us,” one Israeli official said.
            
            And many of the remaining Israeli hostages are also believed to be in even worse condition, the officials said. “From this moment onward, we expect worse scenes,” a second Israeli official said.
            
            Eli Sharabi, Or Levy and Ohad Ben Ami were paraded by Hamas militants during a handover ceremony on Saturday, the three latest Israeli hostages to be freed by the militant group since the implementation of the ceasefire-for-hostages deal between Israel and Hamas.
            
            The three men appeared drastically thinner than before their release, and their relatives subsequently raised concerns about their physical and mental treatment during their captivity.Hamas has since postponed the next hostage release scheduled to take place in Gaza on Saturday “until further notice,” accusing Israel of breaking the ceasefire deal. This has heightened fears surrounding the status and wellbeing of the dozens of Israelis still being held in the enclave.

            Israel’s intelligence indicates that Hamas has been treating male hostages worse than female captives, the second official said, and there is especially heightened concern for the condition of the male soldiers held captive by Hamas.
            
            Many male hostages have been fed less and kept in far worse condition

        <p><span class="span1">Ukraine</span> As the war in Ukraine grinds toward its fourth year, US President Donald Trump has made clear which world leader he thinks can help America end the conflict: Vladimir Putin’s ally Xi Jinping.

            “Hopefully, China can help us stop the war with, in particular, Russia-Ukraine … they have a great deal of power over that situation, and we’ll work with them,” Trump told political and business elites gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month.
            
            Trump expressed that hope, he has repeatedly said, in a call with the Chinese leader days before being sworn in last month – and it’s a subject that could be raised in the coming days as officials from around the world gather in Munich for an annual security conference.
            
            While Trump may have complicated his plan to orchestrate peace alongside Xi by imposing a blanket 10% tariff on Chinese imports into the United States earlier this month, the war in Ukraine could be a rare issue of collaboration – especially as Beijing looks to avert deepening trade frictions.
            
            “Given the stakes on US-China relations, if Trump prices China’s cooperation as the one critical issue that could improve US-China relations, I think China will be very tempted … (and could) play a helpful role,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington. At the same time, she added, Beijing will be wary of undermining its alignment with Russia.
            
            China has long sought to position itself as a potential peace broker in the conflict –promoting its own vaguely-worded proposal to settle the war. But in the West, its bid has so far been overshadowed by another reality: Beijing’s abiding support for Putin’s Russia.
            
            The stakes would be high for Xi to risk damaging that partnership, which the Chinese leader has built up as a critical part of his broader goals to counter pressure from the West and reshape a world order in China’s favor.
            
            And a negotiating table where Xi has a prominent seat is also one where Putin, not Trump, has a staunch partner – a reality that Washington would have to navigate carefully if it doesn’t want to risk isolating European allies or reach a solution that’s unacceptable to Ukraine, analysts say.
            
            “The real outcome that Beijing would like to avoid is a very much weakened Russia,” said Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore. “Because then … (Beijing) would be lacking one major partner.”

            The report said Jumaa was rushed to a hospital for emergency surgery following the attack.
            
            No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.
            
            In a statement, the national unity government condemned the attack, saying Jumaa’s condition was “stable”.
            
            It added that security agencies have launched an investigation “to track down the perpetrators and uncover the circumstances of the incident”.
            
            “The government emphasised that it will not tolerate any attempts to undermine the security and stability of the state, reaffirming its commitment to taking all necessary measures to ensure the safety of officials and citizens,” the government statement said.
            
            Libya plunged into chaos following a NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. The oil-rich nation has been ruled for most of the past decade by rival governments in eastern and western Libya, each backed by an array of fighter groups and foreign governments.
