    <p><h2 style="text-align: center;">URAAN PAKISTAN provides a Transformative Roadmap for <br>
    Socio-Economic Progress, says Minister for Planning, Development, and <br>
    Special Initiatives, Ahsan Iqbal</h2>
    <div class="container3">
        <span class="span1">Federal Minister</span>for Planning, Development, and Special Initiatives, Ahsan Iqbal, addressed a post-launch press conference today, outlining the key objectives, strategies, and implementation mechanisms for the Government of Pakistan’s ambitious Uraan Pakistan Initiative, launched on December 31, 2024. Speaking to journalists, intellectuals, and policymakers, the Minister reiterated the government’s commitment to transforming Pakistan into a $3 trillion economy by 2047 through targeted reforms and inclusive development.

            The Minister, responsible for coordinating the implementation of Uraan Pakistan across all state institutions and ministries, emphasized that this initiative represents a national commitment to overcoming socio-economic challenges, unlocking the country’s potential, and creating sustainable growth opportunities.
            
            The Minister explained that Uraan Pakistan has been designed to avoid the pitfalls of previous initiatives like Vision 2010 and Vision 2025, which were derailed due to political instability and policy discontinuity. He stated that Uraan Pakistan focuses on policy continuity, stakeholder inclusion, and measurable outcomes. Unlike earlier plans, this initiative is insulated from political disruptions through a robust implementation mechanism that aligns all provinces, ministries, and sectors. Additionally, Uraan Pakistan leverages a collaborative framework that brings together stakeholders from academia, industry, civil society, and international partners to ensure inclusivity and coherence.
            
            Addressing concerns about the ambitious targets set under Uraan Pakistan, Ahsan Iqbal emphasized that the initiative is realistic and grounded in global best practices. He pointed out that it draws inspiration from countries like Malaysia, Turkey, and South Korea, which successfully transformed their economies under similar frameworks. He added that Pakistan’s youth dividend, with 65% of the population under 30, is a unique strength. Empowering the youth through education, skill development, and digital initiatives will unlock a demographic advantage that will drive economic transformation.
            
            The Minister elaborated on the financing strategy for Uraan Pakistan, emphasizing the role of public-private partnerships (PPP) in reducing fiscal burden and mobilizing resources for large-scale infrastructure projects. The government is prioritizing innovative financing models, such as leveraging international development funds and private sector investments, while strengthening the country’s tax systems to improve revenue generation. He explained that the initiative is not solely a government-led effort but a partnership with the private sector, development partners, and society at large.
            
            The minister categorically stated that CPEC remains a central pillar in Uraan Pakistan’s implementation. The Minister highlighted the transformative impact of the CPEC, which enhance regional trade, connectivity, and infrastructure development. Under CPEC, energy and transportation projects are being expanded to support industrial growth and improve access to key markets in Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. He noted that CPEC is more than a project; it is a game-changer that integrates Pakistan into global value chains and positions the country as a regional economic hub.
            
            The Minister provided an in-depth overview of the 5Es Framework, the cornerstone of Uraan Pakistan, addressing five key pillars of reform. Exports will drive economic growth, with the initiative targeting $60 billion in annual exports by focusing on IT, manufacturing, agriculture, creative industries, manpower, and minerals. Rebranding “Made in Pakistan” as a global standard for quality is expected to stabilize the rupee, reduce import reliance, and unlock sustained growth.
            
            E-Pakistan aims to create a digitally empowered economy, expanding the ICT freelancing industry to $5 billion, producing 200,000 IT graduates annually, and fostering robust AI and cybersecurity capabilities. These efforts will position Pakistan as a global technology hub and create millions of jobs for youth.
            
            Environmental sustainability is also a priority, with measurable goals such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50%, expanding cultivable land by 20.3 million acres, and increasing water storage capacity by 10 million acre-feet. These measures will safeguard natural resources, ensure food and water security, and enhance disaster resilience.
            
            For energy and infrastructure, the initiative focuses on transitioning to renewable energy with a 10% share in the energy mix, doubling railway freight transport to 25%, and leveraging regional connectivity for trade expansion. These steps are expected to drive <img src="./images/IMG_7315-1019x1024.jpeg" width="200" height="190" border="2px"><br>economic progress and foster regional integration.
            
            Finally, equity, ethics, and empowerment are at the heart of the initiative. Efforts to improve literacy rates by 10%, raise female labor force participation by 17%, and reduce youth unemployment to 6% will foster a just and inclusive society that empowers marginalized groups and ensures social cohesion.
            
            Ahsan Iqbal emphasized the establishment of the National Economic Transformation Unit (NETU), tasked with ensuring the initiative’s effective implementation and accountability. NETU will employ a results-based management system to monitor progress, track key performance indicators, and recalibrate strategies as needed. Stakeholder engagement is central to Uraan Pakistan’s success, with input from over 2,000 experts shaping its framework. The government has mobilized the Champions of Reforms network to support governance reforms and established the Pakistan Centennial 2047 Lab as a hub for innovation and collaboration.
            
            The Minister also highlighted risk management frameworks to mitigate emerging challenges and ensure timely course corrections. Continuous feedback from stakeholders will be integrated into decision-making to keep the initiative aligned with evolving priorities.
            
            Concluding his address, Ahsan Iqbal called on all Pakistanis to unite in support of Uraan Pakistan. He urged the private sector to invest in innovation and growth, academia to drive research and advocacy, and the media to amplify the initiative’s message. He stated that the success of Uraan Pakistan depends on collective effort, and together, Pakistan can build a prosperous, inclusive, and globally competitive nation by 2047.</p>
